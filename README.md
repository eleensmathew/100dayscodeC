# 100 days of coding with C
Hello!

I made this repository to motivate myself to do the 100 days of code challenge. I will try to do most of the code using C language. Repository also may or may not contain my cheat sheets. Study material used is from https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university repository.
